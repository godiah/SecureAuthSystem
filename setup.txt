Generate an App Password (if 2-Step Verification is enabled):

If you have 2-Step Verification enabled for your Google account, you'll need to generate an app password specifically for your PHP application.
Go to the "Security" settings in your Google account.
Scroll down to the "Signing in to Google" section.
Click on "App passwords." You may need to enter your Google account password again for security purposes.
Select "Mail" from the dropdown list and "Other" for the app.
Click "Generate."
Copy the generated app password. This is the password you'll use in your PHP mailer configuration.
Configure PHP Mailer:

In your PHP code where you set up PHP Mailer, configure it to use Gmail's SMTP server with the following settings:

    $mail->isSMTP();
    $mail->Host = 'smtp.gmail.com';
    $mail->Port = 587; // or 465 for SSL
    $mail->SMTPSecure = 'tls'; // or 'ssl' for SSL
    $mail->SMTPAuth = true;
    $mail->Username = 'your@gmail.com'; // Your Gmail address
    $mail->Password = 'your-app-password'; // Use the generated app password here
    Test Your Configuration:

After configuring PHP Mailer, send a test email to verify that everything is working correctly.
